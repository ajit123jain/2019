Ques. Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull() and an additional operation getMin() which should return minimum element from the SpecialStack. All these operations of SpecialStack must be O(1). To implement SpecialStack, you should only use standard Stack data structure and no other data structure like arrays, list, etc.

Queue : BFS 
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.

E.Give past example of problem solving 


Trie :
Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure.But Storage Retrival BST M*log(N) but log(m).Tries is a tree that stores strings. Maximum number of children of a node is equal to size of alphabet. Trie supports search, insert and delete operations in O(L) time where L is length of key. With Trie, we can insert and find strings in O(L) time where L represent the length of a single word. This is obviously faster that BST. This is also faster than Hashing because of the ways it is implemented. We do not need to compute any hash function. No collision handling is required (like we do in open addressing and separate chaining).Another advantage of Trie is, we can easily print all words in alphabetical order which is not easily possible with hashing.Wecan efficently Autocomplete with Trie.
The final conclusion is regarding tries data structure is that they are faster but require huge memory for storing the strings.

But in we need so many node and corresponding thier children too.Ternary Seach tree :Prefix search and Alphbate 


Hashing:
In hashing, we convert key to a small value and the value is used to index data. Hashing supports search, insert and delete operations in O(L) time on average.

BST
The time complexity of search, insert and delete operations in a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) (like Red-Black Tree, AVL Tree, Splay Tree, etc) is O(L Log n) where n is total number words and L is length of word. The advantage of Self balancing BSTs is that they maintain order which makes operations like minimum, maximum, closest (floor or ceiling) and k-th largest faster. 

Advantage of Hash table over

Digital Healthcare System 
1.From last 1 year working year as a software enginner in this We arund 100+ hospitals So we have lots of data SO manage that we need strategy We are using mongo db for backend and For Fullstak we are using ROR.UI Design as it is B2B product We more Focus on usability and comfortable for the user.We use bootstrap 3.4.In Fundamental for creating a appointment User need to search a patient So what we do there have When new patient is creating We store that data in table and also store some data in another table for Quick search and in that We have fields that required for searching like in product We have products acoording to brands and Type and price.In this storing in UTC format so that we can convert in time zone according to which timezone software is using.

2.Air line database Management System.:
We used An Postgresql database in this project.So Basically in this A use can find all the flight from a single company like indigo and other.Now He can search flight form a single Source other destination with date and time.Now when User book a ticket we give a pne nuber to the user corresponding to that pnr another table where foreign key is pnr-number so that we find all the visitor's detail.
End We can get the fare detailsby search the flight for same end-points then also we can for according to flight owner.Now We can filter flight from their Departure time to arrival time also.ilter also like flight is Domestic and international.
Check fare details according to passenger type children army and old-age person.We show all possibile form one destination to another destination.

3.Search Engine:
In that We had lots of Data set around 3-4 Gbs.for Indexing I gone through all those files for index one file We read one by one and Remove special character from the files and Now tokenize the line on space now go through all the tokens if token not a Stops words then we Stem that word and check its their in our inverted index or not if not then create hash and put into inverted index a hashmap which having filename and frequency in that file for that word.If Yes then get that hashmap and update its frequency update.And If is has key but not file then add file with 1 frequency.
Now for searching a keyword check that index is there or not if yes then We go for Query file and check rmeove special character from the query
and same hashmap for the Query with word and frequency in the query 
Frequnecy of word in the query * log(total no of file / present of words file count)
Frequnecy of word in file * log(total no of file / present of words file count)

Insertion Sort
It is efficient for smaller data sets, but very inefficient for larger lists.
Insertion Sort is adaptive, that means it reduces its total number of steps if a partially sorted array is provided as input, making it efficient.
It is better than Selection Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms.
Its space complexity is less. Like bubble Sort, insertion sort also requires a single additional memory space.

System Design Interview
If you haven’t realized it yet, the end result of the exercise above would yield significantly different results. For my own specific background, I might delve really deeply into API design and backend infrastructure. I’d probably explore iPhone-specific problems as well, due to my experience. I’ll talk about how the client interacts with the middle-tier endpoints, how logging would work, how I’d design the backend to ensure uptime, and so on.

https://www.job-hunt.org/job_interviews/answering-why-leaving-current-job.shtml
6 key considerations before switching software
1. Consider where to host the software.
2. Consider what to do with your existing data.
3. Consider creating a “must-have” list.
4. Consider the accounting function in your business system.
5. Consider third party interfaces.
6. Consider all aspects of training.


Some of the most common, and easiest to explain, reasons for leaving a job include:
1.Desire to learn.
2.Desire to take on more responsibility.
3.Desire to take on less responsibility.
4.Desire to relocate
5.Desire for a career change.
6.Desire to gain a new skill or grow a current skill.
7.Company reorganization has led to change in job content.
8.Desire for a shorter commute to work.
9.Desire to improve work/life balance.


Most importantly, demonstrate that you are dignified and professional and will not talk disparagingly about another company or boss.

"I am interested in learning more about (something this job includes), and this job provides an opportunity to leverage my current areas of expertise and increase my skills in..."
"Your focus here is on (something that you like), and I really enjoy doing (whatever that is). So, I expect to increase my enjoyment of my work when I am able to focus more on (that aspect of the job)."
"I enjoy working as part of a team and am looking for an opportunity to work on an interesting project. This job is part of a team working on a fascinating project, and I would love to join in this work."


Current Employer 
"I’ve enjoyed working with a great group of people at my current employer, but this opportunity in this company fits very well with the direction I want to take my career. 
I’ve learned a great deal in my current job, but I’m interested in working at [name of employer] based on the great things I have learned about this organization.
"This job has been a great experience, but growth is limited because the company is relatively small. So, to continue to grow, I need to look elsewhere, and working in this this opportunity looks very interesting to me because…
