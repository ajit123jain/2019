Steps to access preproduction server

To access your instance:
Open an SSH client. 
Locate your private key file (HG-PREPRODUCTION.pem). The wizard automatically detects the key you used to launch the instance.
Your key must not be publicly viewable for SSH to work. Use this command if needed:
chmod 400 HG-PREPRODUCTION.pem
Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
ssh -i "HG-PREPRODUCTION.pem" ubuntu@52.74.19.154 -p 722

Example:

ssh -i "HG-PREPRODUCTION.pem" ubuntu@52.74.19.154 -p 722

Please note that in most cases the username above will be correct, however, please ensure that you read your AMI usage instructions to ensure that the AMI owner has not changed the default AMI username.
